Brain tumor identification is really challenging task in early stages of life. But now
it became advanced with various machine learning algorithms. In Order to detect the brain
tumor of a patient we consider the data of patients like MRI images.
Here our problem is to identify whether tumor is present in patients brain or not.
So we are  using cnn to predict the cases.
